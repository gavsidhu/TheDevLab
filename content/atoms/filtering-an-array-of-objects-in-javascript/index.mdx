One of the most common tasks in JavaScript is manipulating and filtering arrays. When working with arrays of objects, filtering becomes even more important, because it allows us to
efficiently find and display data based on certain conditions.

Imagine you're working on a project that displays a list of products on an e-commerce website. You want to build a feature that filters the products based on their category,
allowing shoppers to find items they're interested in.

Here's what your products data may like:

```javascript:productsData.js
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', category: 'Electronics' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Shoes', category: 'Fashion' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Headphones', category: 'Electronics' },
  { id: 4, name: 'T-shirt', category: 'Fashion' },
];
```

Let's say that a shopper wants to view all the electronics.

Here's how you can implement that:

```javascript:index.json
const products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics" },
  { id: 2, name: "Shoes", category: "Fashion" },
  { id: 3, name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics" },
  { id: 4, name: "T-shirt", category: "Fashion" }
];

function filterProductsByCategory(products, category) {
  return products.filter(product => product.category === category);
}

const filteredProducts = filterProductsByCategory(products, "Electronics");
console.log(filteredProducts);
```

After you run the code, `filteredProducts` variable will contain a new array with only the products that belong to the "Electronics" category.

Here's what `filteredProducts` looks like:

```javascript
[
  { id: 1, name: 'Laptop', category: 'Electronics' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Headphones', category: 'Electronics' },
];
```

## Explanation:

In the code, we have an array of objects called products, with each object representing a product with an id, name, and category. Our goal is to create a new array
containing only the products that belong to a specific category ("Electronics").

To accomplish this, we define a function called filterProductsByCategory, which takes two arguments: the array of products and the desired category.

Inside the function, we use the Array.prototype.filter() method to create a new array with only the products that match the specified category.

The `filter()` method takes a callback function as an argument, which is called for each element in the array.

If the callback function returns true, the element is included in the new array. In our case, the callback function is an arrow function that checks if the category
property of each product object matches the provided category argument ("Electronics").

Applying this code to our e-commerce website scenario, we can quickly filter the list of products to show only those in the desired category. This helps enhance the user's experience and
helps customers find the items they're looking for with ease.
